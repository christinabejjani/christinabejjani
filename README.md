#### Course Websites:

* I taught Introduction to Cognitive Psychology in the summer of 2019 at Duke University. The repository of materials is forked here & the site is https://cogpsychduke2019.github.io/

* As part of my Bass Digital Education Fellowship at Duke University, I am developing a course on Introductory Programming for Online Social Science Experiments. The repository is actually an organization (https://github.com/socsciprogramming) so that in the future, anyone can join & update the material. That way, the class will be community-driven and hopefully long lasting!

#### Website:

* I also have a repository for my website, https://christinabejjani.github.io/. However, that's private, since I figured no one wants to get updates in their feed when I need to make a few quick changes.

#### Random:

* Brenda Yang and I also co-mentored Taylor Albus as he used React.js to develop the web application, Mindset Mapper (mindsetmapper.org, https://talbus.github.io/mindsetmap/#/). See the forked Github repository `mindsetmap`.
